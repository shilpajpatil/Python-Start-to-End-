Multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking.

Process: A process is an instance of a computer program being executed.

Thread: A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Thread is a sequance of such instructions within a program that can be exicuted independetly of other code.

for creating a thread object we use following syntax.

		t1 = threading.Thread(target, arg)

		target= function to be exicuted by the thread
		arg   = argument to be passed to the function

start() = once the thread start the current program also keeps on executing.

join() = program wait for completion of current thread to execute next.
